Subtitler
=========

A subtitle synchronization application for Windows

This is an application I created for my own private usage, but decided to publish it for you.
You select a specific location on your HDD which contains the movies and their subtitles.

Click on a movie file in the left list view to load it - it will start playing.
Note that you are advised to download a codec pack in order for it to work with various formats.

Click on a subtitle file (currently only .srt files are supported) to load it.

Once you do, you will see the complete file in a text box to help you with the syncing, and the first and last subtitles.
Click on the < button next to the subtitle to sync it to the current position in the movie.

Click on the Save button to save the subtitle - note that currently it will *overwrite* the subtitle.


This application is written using WPF.

I hope you'll enjoy it and find it useful as I do :)

Good luck,
Shahar
